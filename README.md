# .github

Org-wide defaults for every PlantechHubDev repo. GitHub applies the files under `.github/` to any repo that has none of its own:

- `pull_request_template.md`: the PR description every repo uses.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Bug, Feature and Task, matching the org's issue types.

**Why one place.** Issues and PRs read the same way in every repo, so triage and review don't depend on which repo you are in, and a template changes once instead of per repo. Repos therefore don't keep their own issue templates; conventions are in the engineering handbook (`workflow.md`).

This repo is public, because GitHub only applies org defaults from a public `.github` repo. Never put anything sensitive here.
